## ¿How does it works?
It can be tested via an electronic prototype builted for visualizing the application results. 
You can see my video testing and showing the prototype:

# Get started
```bash
  npm install
  cd MetroApp

```
### once started you will se a signup/signin screen like this

when you already set it all now you need to get into the prototype connection.
In the ESP32 code you will se ssid and password to edit to your local connection

When you upload the code and ran correctly you will see in the serial or LCD screen a IP connection that is going to be your websocket IP to communicate between app/prototype

if everything goes correctly you will get a message confirming your connection in the pass section:
